1. Represent the height in cm information of a team of 12 basketball players as a matrix of dimension 4x3 in row major form.
```{r}
heights <- c(150, 165, 133, 155, 177, 187, 165, 190, 173, 149, 134, 157)
m <- matrix(heights, nrow = 4, ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE)
m
```
2. Access the height at row 3 and column 2.
```{r}
m[3,2]
```
3. Display all the heights in row 2.
```{r}
m[2,]
```
4. Display all the heights in column 3.
```{r}
m[,3]
```
5. Extract the heights in all rows but only in column 1 and 3.
```{r}
m[,c(1,3)]
```
6. Find the transpose of the matrix.
```{r}
t(m)
```
7. Four more players got added to the team. Update the matrix to reflect the heights of the players.
```{r}
m<-cbind(m,c(150, 151, 152, 153))
m
```
8. Append three more playersâ€™ height in the matrix.
```{r}
m<-rbind(m,c(160, 161, 162))
m
```
